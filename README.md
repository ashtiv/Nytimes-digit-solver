# Nytimes-digits-solver

The NYTimes Digits game presents players with six numbers and a target sum. The goal is to find as many ways as possible to reach the target sum using each of the six numbers and the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The code i provided generates all permutations of the six numbers and the four operations, and evaluates each expression to check if it equals the target sum. It expresses the six numbers and operations in all possible ways, then calculates the result of each expression. If an expression evaluates to the target sum, it prints that expression.
